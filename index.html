      <h2>🩸 About the Creator</h2>
      <p> Hi. I’m the girl who built this site with nothing but a laptop, a lifetime of repressed trauma, and just enough unhealed rage to make it productive. Welcome to my TED Talk or whatever this could be called. 
 I created DOA because I’m sooo fucking tired of watching predators roam free. Tired of the “well, technically” arguments. Tired of grown adults defending literal creeps like they’re misunderstood poets instead of human trash bags. Its fucking disgusting. I know this site isn't put all together the best, but it's my first time doing something like this. Bare with me, it'll be better soon.
 I'm not here for debate. I’m not here for “nuance.” I’m here to make predators uncomfortable — and if that offends you, congrats! You probably belong on the Wall of Shame. 
 My hobbies include rage baiting, scamming preds, listening to music pretty much 24/7, and stress-scrolling through dark web forums to find dumbasses that'll be dumb enough to not use a vpn, and easy to grab their IP and more so i can doxx them. Fun, i know. Holy unemployed. (jk, i have a 9-5. unfortunately)
 I built this site to be everything I never had growing up — a place where you're allowed to expose, rant, and absolutely obliterate the people who deserve it. No apologies. No backpedaling. No "but they were hurting too" excuses. 
 You’ll find shitposts, rants, memes, confessions, and plenty of fire here. It’s a community space for people who are mad for the right reasons or just want to post whatever for whatever reason. No judgment at all. But, ofc, the main reason of the site is obvious.
 If you’re someone who still believes in “second chances” for creeps who ruin lives — I promise you, this site will be your hell.
 And I sleep great knowing that. .</p>
